* [`GEE Summary-Pahvant By Hydro Div.ipynb`](https://github.com/inkenbrandt/Pahvant_Notebooks/blob/master/GEE%20Summary-Pahvant%20By%20Hydro%20Div.ipynb) takes output from [Pahvant/Zonal_Summary Google Earth Engine code](https://code.earthengine.google.com/17c7cf17d4bbcf97f29ea50bf63d2859) and summarizes it into units of acre-feet/year and acre-feet per water year
* [`Water Budget Remote Sensing Calculations.ipynb`](https://github.com/inkenbrandt/Pahvant_Notebooks/blob/master/Water%20Budget%20Remote%20Sensing%20Calculations.ipynb) reads in summary data produced by `GEE Summary-Pahvant By Hydro Div.ipynb` and does volumetric calculations on various watersheds in the region.
* [`Spring Analysis.ipynb`](https://github.com/inkenbrandt/Pahvant_Notebooks/blob/master/Spring%20Analysis.ipynb) compiles and analyzes data from Clear Lake Spring. Fits stage data to flow values. Determines trends of spring data.  Compares spring data to groundwater pumping.
* [`Well_Water_Use.ipynb`](https://github.com/inkenbrandt/Pahvant_Notebooks/blob/master/Well_Water_Use.ipynb) Pulls water use data from Water Rights website. Examines and fits statistical distributions to pumping and duration data. Generates Monte Carlo estimates of water pumpage.
* [`Aquifer_Properties_Estimates.ipynb`](https://github.com/inkenbrandt/Pahvant_Notebooks/blob/master/Aquifer_Properties_Estimates.ipynb) Uses probable distributions of aquifer storativity and measured groundwater level changes to estimate storage change. Combines storage change to earlier calculations of discharge from `Well_Water_Use.ipynb` and `Spring Analysis.ipynb`
* [`Agricultural Production.ipynb`](https://github.com/inkenbrandt/Pahvant_Notebooks/blob/master/Agricultural%20Production.ipynb) plots agricultural production data.
* [`Zonal_ET-New`](https://github.com/inkenbrandt/Pahvant_Notebooks/blob/master/Zonal_ET-New.ipynb) rapid zonal statistics using complex polygons and multiple rasters downloaded from GEE and OpenET.
* [`Pavahnt Regional GW Levels and Pumping Saq.ipynb`](https://github.com/inkenbrandt/Pahvant_Notebooks/blob/master/Pavahnt%20Regional%20GW%20Levels%20and%20Pumping%20Saq.ipynb) estimation of Storativity using Ryan Smith approach, comparing groundwater level change to groundwater pumping
